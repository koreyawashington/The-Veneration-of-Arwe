Project Title-
The project I created was a snake game. The snake game title is "The Veneration of Arwe. My game is based off of a mythology story of the serpent king that once ruled, the land that is known as Ethiopia, for 400 years before the Solomonic Dynasty.

Motivation-
I am a student taking a Software Engineering course at Perscholas, for the first big project week the students were assigned to create a basic game using knowledge from html, css, and javascript. I was motivated to create this game from reading a book about javascript and one of the beginner games inside of that book was making a snake game. I choose the snake game because I major in mathematics and I like coming up with formulas using math.() methods. I wanted to be creative when brainstorming and add a story line based off of a real snake story. So I googled a mythological story based in Ethiopia about a snake and found out about Arwe the Snake King who ruled for 400 years until he was defeated by the Solomonic Dynasty. I gave my game and Ethiopian Theme because I believe that the first human life forms were traced furthest back to the land of ethiopia and I am believer in Haile Selassie I and Empress Menen so I gave my game my very own personal touch.

Build Status-

Code Style-
If using any code style like xo, standard ect. That will help others while contributing to you project

Screenshots-
Include logo/demo screenshot etc

Tech/FrameWorks Used-

Features-
My version of the snake games stands out because it is based off of a mythological snake and uses real ethiopian drawings of the storyline. 

Improvements/Upgrades-
I would like to start with I want to add more levels like easy, medium, hard. I need to practice moving my divs around without moving other content or adding a page scroll on the side of the projects. After the win state the snake keeps going sometimes and runs into the wall and alerts the losing state, I want that to go away as well. I also wanted to add small section for the music to be be able to fast forward and rewind because the Bob Marley songs plays for a long while and it would be cool to hear the greatest hits without refreshing and having to wait but I enjoy the free concert.

Code Example-
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Installation-
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running

API Reference-
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples

How To Use?-
If people like your project they will want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project

Contribute-
Please leave constructive feedback that contribute to making my project better! I am a first time engineer with little to no prior experience in coding. I know that I have a long way to go when it comes to coding and design, if you have any helpful tips or advice on how I can make my game better. Feel free to share resources on how I can improve for the future of my software engineering career.

Credits-
Thank you to my ,ain instructors Abraham T. and Colton W. for teaching me the basics to coding at PerScholas! Thank you Laura, a supporting staff at PerScholas for joining our class and being so motivational.

Saving the best for last, I want to give a loving thanks to my Husband for motivating me to go to school and being the first person to try my version of the snake game and love it. Thank you to my two year old son who cheered me on as I tried out my new game! Special thanks to my 7 month old daughter who filled the entire home with her cheerful screams throughout the brainstorming and making of this game. I love you all. I want to give the upmost important thanks to the Most High God for blessing me with the courage, strength and wisdom to reaching my goals. JAH BLESS. I love you!!!
