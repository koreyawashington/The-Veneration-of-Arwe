Project Title-
The project I created was a snake game. The snake game title is "The Veneration of Arwe. My game is based off of a mythology story of the serpent king that once terrorized, the land that is known as Ethiopia, for 400 years before the Solomonic Dynasty.

Motivation-
I am a student taking a Software Engineering course at Perscholas, for the first big project week the students were assigned to create a basic game using knowledge from html, css, and javascript. I was motivated to create this game from reading a book about javascript and one of the beginner games inside of that book was making a snake game. I choose the snake game because I major in mathematics and I like coming up with formulas using math.() methods. I wanted to be creative when brainstorming and add a story line based off of a real snake story. So I googled a mythological story based in Ethiopia about a snake and found out about Arwe the Snake King who ruled for 400 years until he was defeated by the Solomonic Dynasty. I gave my game and Ethiopian Theme because I believe that the first human life forms were traced furthest back to the land of ethiopia and I am believer in Haile Selassie I and Empress Menen so I gave my game its very own personality.

Build Status-

Code Style-
If using any code style like xo, standard ect. That will help others while contributing to the project.

Screenshots-
Include logo/demo screenshot etc

Tech/FrameWorks Used-
There is no official framework for my project. I honestly free styled the entire thing but I wanted my game to look like that XBOX Bruce Lee game from some years back.
Features-
My version of the snake games stands out because it is based off of real Ethiopian mythological and uses real Ethiopian drawings of the storyline. My game features multiple pages to help create the storyline, a different song for each page of my game. My game is very colorful and appealing and soft on the eyes with color coordination.

Improvements/Upgrades-
I would like to start with I want to add more levels like easy, medium, hard. I need to practice moving my divs around without moving other content or adding a page scroll on the side of the projects. After the win state the snake keeps going sometimes and runs into the wall and alerts the losing state, I want that to go away as well. I also wanted to add small section for the music to be be able to fast forward and rewind because the Bob Marley songs plays for a long while and it would be cool to hear the greatest hits without refreshing and having to wait but I enjoy the free concert.

Code Example-
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

Installation-
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running

API Reference-
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples

How To Use-
To use my project on a live server be mindful that this page is built to work on a computer or laptop only not a touchscreen or other device. The first thing the Player should be directed towards is the cover page, enjoy the music and read the title and a quick summary of the campaign of my game, then when the Player is done there are three option to allow the player to be able to click back and forth between pages with the website. The second page of my website is the campaign of my project. A campaign is an organized course of action to achieve a desired goal. The goal of my 'Campaign' is to give a storyline as to where the story of my snake in my snake game originates from, it tells about an ancient story that is based in Ethiopia. Enjoy the music and read the story line of my game, then notice at the bottom of the screen again there will be a navigation to go back to the home page, the third page, or directly to the game play. When the 'Instructions' option is clicked, the Player will then be directed towards the instructions of the game that will explain how the game is played, how to win/lose, and what controls are being used to play the game. Again notice the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen to either go back to the previous page or to navigate to the very last page of the website which is the page that contains the game and how to play. Once the Player have clicked to the last page 'Defeat the Serpent' the Player notice there is a navigation button that allows the Player to navigate back to the instruction page ,leading to the navigation guides of the previous pages. The player will notice the game board that is ready to play on the push of any of the arrow keys on the keyboard. There is a refresh button located on the right side of the screen that will refresh the game at any time and when there is a win or lose result in the game. I also added a div on the left side of the screen that will keep track of how many rounds have been passed and what the score is that will update live with each point the Player score(how many lambs are eaten(rounds) and the score increase).If the Player moves and touches the side of the wall or if the snake touches any part of the snake's body the game will alert that the Player have lost and the Player must try again by clicking the refresh button on the right. For each time the snake eats the lamb on the board, the round will increase by 1 and the score will increase by 21. If the Player eat 20 lambs and reach a score of 420 (the game will automatically increase the round and score according to each other so both winning conditions will be met at the same time) the game will alert a winning message to let the Player know that the Player have won, the Player can check your score at the bottom of the div on the left side .The player can play again by clicking the refresh button on the right side of the page. 

Contribute-
Please leave constructive feedback that contribute to making my project better! I am a first time engineer with little to no prior experience in coding. I know that I have a long way to go when it comes to coding and design, if you have any helpful tips or advice on how I can make my game better. Feel free to share resources on how I can improve for the future of my software engineering career.

Credits-
Thank thank you to my main instructors Abraham T. and Colton W. for teaching me the basics to coding at PerScholas! Thank you Laura M., a supporting teacher at PerScholas for joining our class and being so motivational.

Saving the best for last, I want to give a loving thanks to my Husband for motivating me to go to school and being the first person to try my version of the snake game and love it. Thank you to my two year old son who cheered me on as I tried out my new game! Special thanks to my 7 month old daughter who filled the entire home with her cheerful screams throughout the brainstorming and making of this game. I love you all. I want to give the upmost important thanks to the Most High God for blessing me with the courage, strength and wisdom to reaching my goals. JAH BLESS. I love you!!!
