# Project Title

My project is a snake game and the title of my game is "The Veneration of Arwe". This game is dedicated to the Solomonic Dynasty.

THIS PROJECT WAS BUILT WITH VISUAL STUDIO CODE(HTML,CSS,and Javascript)

Motivation-
I am a student taking a Software Engineering course at Perscholas, for the first big project week the students were assigned to create a basic game using knowledge from html, css, and javascript. I was motivated to create this game from reading a book about javascript and one of the beginner games inside of that book was making a snake game. I choose the snake game because I major in mathematics and I like coming up with formulas using math.() methods. I wanted to be creative when brainstorming and add a story line based off of a real snake story. So I googled a mythological story based in Ethiopia about a snake and found out about Arwe the Snake King who ruled for 400 years until he was defeated by the Solomonic Dynasty. I gave my game and Ethiopian Theme because I believe that the first human life forms were traced furthest back to the land of ethiopia and I am believer in Haile Selassie I and Empress Menen so I gave my game its very own personality.

How To Use-
To use my project on a live server be mindful that this page is built to work on a computer or laptop only not a touchscreen or other device. The first thing the Player should be directed towards is the cover page, enjoy the music and read the title and a quick summary of the campaign of my game, then when the Player is done there are three option to allow the player to be able to click back and forth between pages with the website. The second page of my website is the campaign of my project. A campaign is an organized course of action to achieve a desired goal. The goal of my 'Campaign' is to give a storyline as to where the story of my snake in my snake game originates from, it tells about an ancient story that is based in Ethiopia. Enjoy the music and read the story line of my game, then notice at the bottom of the screen again there will be a navigation to go back to the home page, the third page, or directly to the game play. When the 'Instructions' option is clicked, the Player will then be directed towards the instructions of the game that will explain how the game is played, how to win/lose, and what controls are being used to play the game. Again notice the navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen to either go back to the previous page or to navigate to the very last page of the website which is the page that contains the game and how to play. Once the Player have clicked to the last page 'Defeat the Serpent' the Player notice there is a navigation button that allows the Player to navigate back to the instruction page ,leading to the navigation guides of the previous pages. The player will notice the game board that is ready to play on the push of any of the arrow keys on the keyboard. There is a refresh button located on the right side of the screen that will refresh the game at any time and when there is a win or lose result in the game. I also added a div on the left side of the screen that will keep track of how many rounds have been passed and what the score is that will update live with each point the Player score(how many lambs are eaten(rounds) and the score increase).If the Player moves and touches the side of the wall or if the snake touches any part of the snake's body the game will alert that the Player have lost and the Player must try again by clicking the refresh button on the right. For each time the snake eats the lamb on the board, the round will increase by 1 and the score will increase by 21. If the Player eat 20 lambs and reach a score of 420 (the game will automatically increase the round and score according to each other so both winning conditions will be met at the same time) the game will alert a winning message to let the Player know that the Player have won, the Player can check your score at the bottom of the div on the left side .The player can play again by clicking the refresh button on the right side of the page.

## Contributing

Please leave constructive feedback that contribute to making my project better! I am a first time engineer with little to no prior experience in coding. I know that I have a long way to go when it comes to coding and design, if you have any helpful tips or advice on how I can make my game better. Feel free to share resources on how I can improve for the future of my software engineering career.

Credits-
Thank thank you to my main instructors Abraham T. and Colton W. for teaching me the basics to coding at PerScholas! Thank you Laura M., a supporting teacher at PerScholas for joining our class and being so motivational.

Saving the best for last, I want to give a loving thanks to my Husband for motivating me to go to school and being the first person to try my version of the snake game and love it. Thank you to my two year old son who cheered me on as I tried out my new game! Special thanks to my 7 month old daughter who filled the entire home with her cheerful screams throughout the brainstorming and making of this game. I love you all. I want to give the upmost important thanks to the Most High God for blessing me with the courage, strength and wisdom to reaching my goals. JAH BLESS. I love you!!!
## Features
My version of the snake games stands out because it is based off of real Ethiopian mythological and uses real Ethiopian drawings of the storyline. My game features multiple pages to help create the storyline, a different song for each page of my game. My game is very colorful and appealing and soft on the eyes with color coordination.

## Lessons Learned

What did you learn while building this project? What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?

I learned how to edit the type of script used to module 1 to allow me to use multiple javascript files and how to import and export them to separate each of the main key control areas of the the game that I created.

I struggled with deploying my website to a live github server. I was able to over come it by reaching out to my classmates and she was able to help me resolve my problem even though she had never encountered my problem before. I had to change the name of my html to index.html because I had a previous name for the first html page and github was only showing me the readMe file. My class mate told me that she saw many solutions to fix this issue and she said that the main website page should be named index.html for github to deploy my page.


## Installation

My project does not need to be installed but you can visit my live github page at this website: (https://koreyawashington.github.io/The-Veneration-of-Arwe/game.html)
